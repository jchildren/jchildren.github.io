A filter for Drupal that uses Pandoc to convert markup

This module allows you to use the pandoc-php module as a filter for drupal 7 text formats. The module provides a small number of settings and will produce either html or html5 output to be used in the display of drupal fields.

The module is currently very experimental and has only been tested with the mediawiki format under very controlled conditions and could potentially represent a security risk so it should not be used in production in its current form.
