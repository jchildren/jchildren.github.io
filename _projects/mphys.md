description: "Simulation of spin qubit decoherence due to hyperfine interaction"

Abstract
-----------------------------
We investiage the properties of simple spin chains, the fermi contact hyperfine
interaction and the comparative strength of external magnetic fields using a program
built from theory.  We find that there is an oscillation of probabilities of states due
to spin interactions, which is found in both the spin chain and hyperfine model.
When the magnetic field is introduced it is found that a probability density shift
occurs.  The timescale of interaction is verified as being related to the interaction
constant for both hyperfine interaction and magnetic fields.
