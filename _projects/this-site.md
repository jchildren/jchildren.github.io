Building this site has also been a project of sorts, though the commit count is a little inflated.

The site uses github pages with jekyll to build the static pages. The css is just a mildly tweaked version
of the  bootstrap cover template and I added a little bit of javascript for the animations of the
navigation bar and the footer.

I have also added a few javascript files like [MathJax][mathjax], [highlight.js][highlight] and [a lightbox][lightbox]
