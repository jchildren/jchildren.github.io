* Migrating legacy database content with consideration for hashed passwords and legacy encoding

Project Student *2013-2014*
---------------------------

<span>University of Leeds</span> <span>Dr Jaewoo Joo</span>

* Created a numerical simulation of measurement based quantum computation with a topological error correction code in Fortran 95 based on the work of my supervisor
* Used LAPACK to improve performance and ensure scalability as well
as provide advanced linear algebra routines such as matrix
decomposition

Project Student *2012-2013*
---------------------------

<span>University of York</span> <span>Prof. Irene D'Amico</span>

* Created numerical and analytical simulations of de-coherence of Qubits in silicon-28 quantum dots due to hyperfine and magnetic interactions
* Generated graphs from results showing the state of the system over time for a range of initial conditions
* Achieved a grade of 71% (4.0)

Research Student *Summer 2012*
------------------------------

<span>University of York</span> <span>Dr Matt Probert</span>

* Built a database of example results from simulations of solid state materials that were run on University computing cluster for a range of bonding types
* Created Perl scripts using the materials studio API to run batches
of simulations on the cluster to optimise input parameters of
simulations
* Designed and coded PHP website to display data from calculations as benchmarks with comparison graphs
