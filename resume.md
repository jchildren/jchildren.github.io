## Education

### MSc Quantum Technologies

#### University of Leeds UK *2013 - 2014*

##### Dissertation: Numerical simulation of one way quantum computation with error correction

* Created a numerical simulation of measurement based quantum computation with error correction in Fortran 95 with LAPACK, achieved a grade of 70% (4.0).

* Studied Quantum Information Theory, Quantum Optics, Next Generation Silicon Technologies

### MPhys Physics with Philosophy

#### University of York UK *2009 - 2013*

##### Dissertation: Numerical simulation of qubit decoherence in silicon-28 due to hyperfine spin interaction

* Produced *ab initio* simulation of spin interactions in silicon-28 quantum dots for degree project, earning a grade of 71% (4.0)

* Studied Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Computing and High Performance Computing


## Technical Experience

### Web Developer

#### Quantiki *2015 - Current*

* Implementing a full stack solution to replace a complex legacy system without data loss or service interruption
* Identifying existing software packages that meet the project requirements and developing new ones where none are available such as a wrapper module for Pandoc
* Selecting the best technologies to use to ensure a reliable service with a long life span and explaining my decisions to the project leaders
* Writing documentation to explain my process for implementation and providing a simple method for deployment so it can be replicated in future if necessary

### Summer Research Student

#### University of York *Summer 2012*

* Built a database of example results from simulations of solid state materials that were run on University computing cluster for a range of bonding types
* Created perl scripts using the materials studio api to run batches of simulations on the cluster to optimise input parameters of simulations
* Designed website to display data from calculations as benchmarks with comparison graphs
