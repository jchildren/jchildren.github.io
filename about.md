This website serves as my personal blog and to some extent, a showcase for my
work.

I am a 24 year old who was born in Canada but has lived in the United Kingdom
for around 19 years who has recently moved back to Canada after graduating from an
MSc program in Quantum Technologies at the University of Leeds.

Since January I've been doing some part time web development for an academic
website which has been an interesting experience, but has allowed me to work on
a bunch of different projects and greatly improve my programming skills. This
has mainly focused on C++ but I've also been working on learning Ruby and very
recently Haskell. I'm very eager to take these skills into a workplace environment
so if you have an interesting project available take a look at my [résumé][resume].

On the academic side, I'm most interested in Quantum Computation,
Philosophy of Science, Solid State Physics and High Performance Computing.
